# IoTExpert_PSoC_Components
This PSoC Creator Library contains all of the PSoC Components that I have built for IoT Expert Projects.  This includes
## FreeRTOS 8.22
I did not create this Component... but I modified it.  I found this component on GitHub about a year ago and I cannot figure out who the original Author of the compnent was.  This is too bad because I would like to give him/her credit for such a nice job on the component.  Obviously this is an implementation of www.freertos.org.
To use the component add a dependency to this library to your PSoC Creator Project.  Then you can drag in the component and you are off to the races.
## MusicPlayer
A song playing component that uses a TCPWM to play notes as defined in an array of notes
## SwitchMatrix

## MatrixLed
